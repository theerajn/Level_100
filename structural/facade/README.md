# Facade Design Pattern

## Definition
Provides a simplified interface to a larger, complex system, hiding the complexities of the subsystem and providing an easy-to-use interface for clients.

## Example Use Case
Travel Booking System

## Advantage
Reduces complexity by providing a simple interface to complex subsystems. Without it, clients must manage multiple subsystem calls directly.

## Impact Analysis

### With Facade Pattern
- Simplified client interface
- Reduced system complexity
- Better code organization and maintainability
- Loose coupling between client and subsystems
- Easy system usage and integration

### Without Facade Pattern
- Complex client interactions with multiple subsystems
- Tight coupling between client and subsystem components
- Difficult system integration and usage
- Increased complexity in client code
- Higher maintenance overhead
