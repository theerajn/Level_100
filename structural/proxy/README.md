# Proxy Design Pattern

## Definition
Provides a placeholder or surrogate to control access to another object, acting as an intermediary that can add additional functionality like access control, caching, or lazy loading.

## Example Use Case
Role-Based Access Control

## Advantage
The Proxy Design Pattern provides a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it. Enables controlled access with additional functionality without modifying the original object.

## Impact Analysis

### With Proxy Pattern
- Controlled and secure object access
- Additional functionality without object modification
- Lazy loading and performance optimization
- Transparent access control implementation
- Flexible access management

### Without Proxy Pattern
- Direct, uncontrolled object access
- No additional security layers
- Immediate resource loading
- Difficult access control implementation
- Limited flexibility in object access management
