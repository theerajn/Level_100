# Bridge Design Pattern

## Definition
Separates abstraction from implementation so they can vary independently, providing a bridge between the abstraction and its implementation.

## Example Use Case
Robot Management

## Advantage
Decouples interface from implementation allowing both to vary independently. Without it, changes in one force changes in the other.

## Impact Analysis

### With Bridge Pattern
- Independent variation of abstraction and implementation
- Loose coupling between interface and implementation
- Easy extension of both abstractions and implementations
- Flexible system architecture
- Better maintainability and scalability

### Without Bridge Pattern
- Tight coupling between abstraction and implementation
- Difficult to modify either independently
- Limited flexibility in system design
- Complex inheritance hierarchies
- Reduced extensibility and maintainability
