# Decorator Design Pattern

## Definition
Dynamically adds new responsibilities or behaviors to objects without changing their code structure, providing a flexible alternative to subclassing.

## Example Use Case
ETL Data Cleaning Pipeline

## Advantage
Adds new functionality dynamically without altering existing classes. Avoids an explosion of subclasses and provides flexible behavior composition at runtime.

## Impact Analysis

### With Decorator Pattern
- Dynamic behavior addition at runtime
- Flexible object composition
- No need for extensive subclass hierarchies
- Easy combination of multiple behaviors
- Maintains object interface consistency

### Without Decorator Pattern
- Static behavior definition at compile time
- Explosion of subclasses for different combinations
- Rigid object structure
- Difficult to combine multiple behaviors
- Complex inheritance hierarchies
