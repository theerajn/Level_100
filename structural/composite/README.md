# Composite Design Pattern

## Definition
Treats individual objects and groups of objects uniformly, allowing clients to work with single objects and compositions of objects in the same way.

## Example Use Case
IoT Sensor Management System

## Advantage
Simplifies working with tree structures by treating individual and composite objects uniformly. Without it, client code must treat single objects and groups differently.

## Impact Analysis

### With Composite Pattern
- Uniform treatment of individual and group objects
- Simplified client code for tree structures
- Easy addition of new component types
- Recursive operations on hierarchical structures
- Flexible tree structure management

### Without Composite Pattern
- Different handling required for individual and group objects
- Complex client code for tree operations
- Difficult to add new component types
- Separate logic needed for different object types
- Complicated tree structure management
