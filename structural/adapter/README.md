# Adapter Design Pattern

## Definition
Converts one interface into another interface clients expect, allowing incompatible interfaces to work together seamlessly.

## Example Use Case
Smart Home Device Adapter

## Advantage
Makes incompatible systems work together without modifying their existing code. Enables integration of third-party libraries and legacy systems into modern applications.

## Impact Analysis

### With Adapter Pattern
- Seamless integration of incompatible systems
- No modification required to existing code
- Easy integration of third-party components
- Flexible system architecture
- Reduced integration complexity

### Without Adapter Pattern
- Impossible integration of incompatible systems
- Extensive code modifications required
- Difficulty in using third-party libraries
- Limited system flexibility
- Complex workarounds needed for integration
