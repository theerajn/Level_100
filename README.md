# Design Patterns

This document lists important **Design Patterns**, grouped into **Creational, Structural, and Behavioural**, with simple definitions, examples, and advantages.

## Creational Design Patterns

### ðŸ”¹ Singleton
- **Definition**: Ensures only one instance of a class exists and provides global access.  
- **Example**: Database Configuration 
- **Advantage**: Prevents multiple instances that could cause conflicts; without it, resources may be wasted or states may become inconsistent.  

### ðŸ”¹ Factory Method
- **Definition**: Provides an interface to create objects, letting subclasses decide which class to instantiate.  
- **Example**: Notification System
- **Advantage**: The Factory Method pattern provides a centralized way of creating objects without exposing the creation logic. Without it, the client would need to handle object instantiation manually using new, which increases coupling and reduces flexibility. 

### ðŸ”¹ Builder
- **Definition**: Constructs complex objects step by step.  
- **Example**: Building structured and customizable emails
- **Advantage**: Allows step-by-step construction of complex objects without requiring a telescoping constructor, and makes the code more readable, flexible, and maintainable.

### ðŸ”¹ Prototype
- **Definition**: Creates new objects by cloning an existing object.  
- **Example**: Car Model Customization
- **Advantage**: Prototype allows creating new objects by cloning existing ones, which avoids the overhead of building objects from scratch. Without it, object creation could be slow, complex, or resource-heavy.  

### ðŸ”¹ Abstract Factory
- **Definition**: Provides an interface to create families of related objects without specifying their concrete classes.  
- **Example**: Document Processing System
- **Advantage**: Allows creating families of related objects without binding client code to specific classes, making the system easily extensible for new product types without changing existing code.

## Structural Design Patterns

### ðŸ”¹ Adapter
- **Definition**: Converts one interface into another interface clients expect.  
- **Example**: Smart Home Device Adapter  
- **Advantage**: Makes incompatible systems work together; without it, integration becomes impossible.  

### ðŸ”¹ Decorator
- **Definition**: Dynamically adds new responsibilities to objects without changing their code.  
- **Example**: ETL Data Cleaning Pipeline
- **Advantage**: Adds new functionality dynamically without altering existing classes; avoids an explosion of subclasses.

### ðŸ”¹ Proxy
- **Definition**: Provides a placeholder or surrogate to control access to another object.  
- **Example**: Role-Based Access Control 
- **Advantage**: The Proxy Design Pattern provides a surrogate or placeholder for another object to control access to it.

### ðŸ”¹ Composite
- **Definition**: Treats individual objects and groups of objects uniformly.  
- **Example**: IoT Sensor Management System 
- **Advantage**: Simplifies working with tree structures; without it, client code must treat single objects and groups differently.  

### ðŸ”¹ Facade
- **Definition**: Provides a simplified interface to a larger system.  
- **Example**: Travel Booking System
- **Advantage**: Reduces complexity; without it, clients must manage multiple subsystem calls directly.  

### ðŸ”¹ Flyweight
- **Definition**: Reduces memory usage by sharing common object data.  
- **Example**: City Traffic Monitoring System
- **Advantage**: Saves memory by reusing shared instances; without it, repeated objects consume large amounts of resources.  

### ðŸ”¹ Bridge
- **Definition**: Separates abstraction from implementation so they can vary independently.  
- **Example**:Robot Management
- **Advantage**: Decouples interface from implementation; without it, changes in one force changes in the other.

##  Behavioural Design Patterns

### ðŸ”¹ Strategy
- **Definition**: Defines a family of algorithms and makes them interchangeable.  
- **Example**: Smart Irrigation System  
- **Advantage**: Eliminates hardcoded algorithms; without it, adding new behavior requires changing existing code.  

### ðŸ”¹ Observer
- **Definition**: One-to-many dependency where changes in one object notify others.  
- **Example**: Live Sports Score Update System
- **Advantage**: Decouples subject from observers; without it, subjects must track and call each dependent manually.  

### ðŸ”¹ State
- **Definition**: Allows an object to change behavior when its internal state changes.  
- **Example**: ATM Machine Simulation.
- **Advantage**: Avoids large conditional logic; without it, code becomes cluttered with if-else statements.  

### ðŸ”¹ Command
- **Definition**: Encapsulates a request as an object.  
- **Example**: Job Scheduler
- **Advantage**: Encapsulates each request as a command object, making the system flexible and extensible.

### ðŸ”¹ Chain of Responsibility
- **Definition**: Passes a request along a chain until itâ€™s handled.  
- **Example**: Spam Email Filtering System
- **Advantage**: Decouples sender and receiver; without it, one handler must know all possible request types.  

### ðŸ”¹ Iterator
- **Definition**: Provides a way to access elements of a collection without exposing its representation.  
- **Example**: Stream Change Simulation  
- **Advantage**: Provides a uniform way to traverse collections without exposing their internal representation.

### ðŸ”¹ Mediator
- **Definition**: Defines an object that coordinates interaction between multiple objects.  
- **Example**:Loan approval workflow
- **Advantage**: All departments interact via the mediator instead of tightly coupling with each other.

### ðŸ”¹ Memento
- **Definition**: Captures and restores an objectâ€™s state without exposing its internals.  
- **Example**: Database Rollback System
- **Advantage**: Restores previous state safely; without it, rollback would require exposing object internals.  

### ðŸ”¹ Template Method
- **Definition**: Defines a skeleton of an algorithm, letting subclasses redefine steps.  
- **Example**: Resume Screening System
- **Advantage**: Promotes code reuse; without it, algorithms must be duplicated with small variations.  

### ðŸ”¹ Visitor
- **Definition**: Separates algorithms from the objects they operate on.  
- **Example**: Healthcare Patient Report System
- **Advantage**: Adds new operations without modifying existing classes; without it, new logic requires editing every class.  

### ðŸ”¹ Interpreter
- **Definition**: Defines a grammar for a language and provides an interpreter to evaluate sentences in that language.
- **Example**: Workflow automation 
- **Advantage**: Allows flexible execution of domain-specific rules; without it, logic would be hardcoded and difficult to change for new rules.
