# Singleton Design Pattern

## Definition
Ensures only one instance of a class exists and provides global access to that instance throughout the application lifecycle.

## Example Use Case
Database Configuration

## Advantage
Prevents multiple instances that could cause conflicts and ensures controlled access to shared resources. Provides a single point of access for global state management and reduces memory overhead by avoiding duplicate instances.

## Impact Analysis

### With Singleton Pattern
- Single instance guaranteed across the application
- Consistent state management
- Controlled resource utilization
- Global access point available
- Prevention of configuration conflicts

### Without Singleton Pattern
- Multiple instances may be created inadvertently
- Resource wastage through duplicate objects
- Potential state inconsistencies
- Configuration conflicts between instances
- Difficulty in maintaining global state
