# Abstract Factory Design Pattern

## Definition
Provides an interface to create families of related objects without specifying their concrete classes, ensuring that created objects are compatible with each other.

## Example Use Case
Document Processing System

## Advantage
Allows creating families of related objects without binding client code to specific classes, making the system easily extensible for new product families without changing existing code.

## Impact Analysis

### With Abstract Factory Pattern
- Consistent object family creation
- Easy addition of new product families
- Guaranteed compatibility between related objects
- Loose coupling between client and concrete products
- Centralized family-specific logic

### Without Abstract Factory Pattern
- Inconsistent object relationships
- Difficult to ensure compatibility between related objects
- Hard to add new product families
- Tight coupling between client and specific implementations
- Scattered creation logic across the system
