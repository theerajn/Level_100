# Builder Design Pattern

## Definition
Constructs complex objects step by step, allowing you to create different types and representations of an object using the same construction process.

## Example Use Case
Building structured and customizable emails

## Advantage
Allows step-by-step construction of complex objects without requiring a telescoping constructor. Makes the code more readable, flexible, and maintainable while providing control over the construction process.

## Impact Analysis

### With Builder Pattern
- Step-by-step object construction
- Readable and maintainable code
- Flexible object creation process
- Avoids telescoping constructor problem
- Clear separation of construction logic

### Without Builder Pattern
- Complex constructors with many parameters
- Difficult to maintain and understand code
- Limited flexibility in object creation
- Potential for incorrect object initialization
- Poor readability with multiple constructor overloads
