# Prototype Design Pattern

## Definition
Creates new objects by cloning an existing object, avoiding the overhead of creating objects from scratch when object creation is expensive.

## Example Use Case
Car Model Customization

## Advantage
Allows creating new objects by cloning existing ones, which avoids the overhead of building objects from scratch. Particularly useful when object creation is expensive or complex.

## Impact Analysis

### With Prototype Pattern
- Fast object creation through cloning
- Reduced initialization overhead
- Easy creation of object variations
- Simplified complex object creation
- Better performance for expensive objects

### Without Prototype Pattern
- Slow and resource-heavy object creation
- Complex initialization processes
- Repeated expensive setup operations
- Difficult creation of object variants
- Higher computational overhead
