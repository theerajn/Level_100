# Iterator Design Pattern

## Definition
Provides a way to access elements of a collection sequentially without exposing the underlying representation of the collection.

## Example Use Case
Stream Change Simulation

## Advantage
Provides a uniform way to traverse collections without exposing their internal representation. Enables consistent iteration across different collection types.

## Impact Analysis

### With Iterator Pattern
- Uniform collection traversal interface
- Hidden internal collection representation
- Support for multiple simultaneous iterations
- Easy switching between different collection types
- Simplified client code for iteration

### Without Iterator Pattern
- Exposed internal collection structure
- Different traversal methods for different collections
- Tight coupling between client and collection implementation
- Difficult to support multiple simultaneous iterations
- Complex client code for different collection types
