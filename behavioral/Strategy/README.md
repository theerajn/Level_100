# Strategy Design Pattern

## Definition
Defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable at runtime without altering the client code.

## Example Use Case
Smart Irrigation System

## Advantage
Eliminates hardcoded algorithms and allows dynamic algorithm selection. Without it, adding new behavior requires changing existing code and creates rigid implementations.

## Impact Analysis

### With Strategy Pattern
- Dynamic algorithm selection at runtime
- Easy addition of new algorithms
- Elimination of conditional statements
- Loose coupling between client and algorithms
- Enhanced code maintainability and flexibility

### Without Strategy Pattern
- Hardcoded algorithms in client code
- Difficult to add new behaviors
- Complex conditional logic structures
- Tight coupling between client and algorithm implementations
- Reduced flexibility and maintainability
