# Visitor Design Pattern

## Definition
Separates algorithms from the objects they operate on, allowing new operations to be added without modifying existing object structures.

## Example Use Case
Healthcare Patient Report System

## Advantage
Adds new operations without modifying existing classes. Without it, new logic requires editing every class, violating the open-closed principle.

## Impact Analysis

### With Visitor Pattern
- Easy addition of new operations
- Separation of algorithms from data structures
- Maintained object structure integrity
- Centralized operation logic
- Enhanced system extensibility

### Without Visitor Pattern
- Modification required in existing classes for new operations
- Mixed algorithm and data structure concerns
- Violation of open-closed principle
- Scattered operation logic across multiple classes
- Difficult maintenance and extension
