# Interpreter Design Pattern

## Definition
Defines a grammar for a language and provides an interpreter to evaluate sentences in that language, enabling custom language processing.

## Example Use Case
Workflow Automation

## Advantage
Allows flexible execution of domain-specific rules and expressions. Without it, logic would be hardcoded and difficult to change for new rules.

## Impact Analysis

### With Interpreter Pattern
- Flexible rule and expression evaluation
- Easy addition of new grammar rules
- Separation of language grammar from implementation
- Dynamic expression processing
- Extensible language capabilities

### Without Interpreter Pattern
- Hardcoded logic for rule processing
- Difficult addition of new rules or expressions
- Rigid system behavior
- Complex conditional logic for rule evaluation
- Limited flexibility in rule management
