# Command Design Pattern

## Definition
Encapsulates a request as an object, allowing you to parameterize clients with different requests, queue operations, and support undo functionality.

## Example Use Case
Job Scheduler

## Advantage
Encapsulates each request as a command object, making the system flexible and extensible. Enables queuing, logging, and undo operations.

## Impact Analysis

### With Command Pattern
- Encapsulated request handling
- Support for undo and redo operations
- Request queuing and scheduling capabilities
- Loose coupling between invoker and receiver
- Easy addition of new command types

### Without Command Pattern
- Direct coupling between invoker and receiver
- No support for undo operations
- Difficult request queuing and scheduling
- Limited flexibility in request handling
- Complex code for operation management
