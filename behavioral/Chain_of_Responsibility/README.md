# Chain of Responsibility Design Pattern

## Definition
Passes a request along a chain of potential handlers until one handles it, decoupling the sender from the receiver.

## Example Use Case
Spam Email Filtering System

## Advantage
Decouples sender and receiver by allowing multiple objects to handle requests. Without it, one handler must know all possible request types.

## Impact Analysis

### With Chain of Responsibility Pattern
- Decoupled sender and receiver relationship
- Dynamic chain configuration at runtime
- Easy addition of new handlers
- Flexible request processing pipeline
- Simplified handler implementation

### Without Chain of Responsibility Pattern
- Tight coupling between sender and specific handlers
- Complex conditional logic for request routing
- Difficult to add new handler types
- Rigid request processing structure
- Complicated handler selection logic
